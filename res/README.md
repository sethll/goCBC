# Research Documentation

This directory contains the scientific research and pharmacokinetic analyses that form the basis for the substance definitions and half-life values used in goCBC.

## Purpose

Each document provides comprehensive literature reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical data supporting the metabolic parameters implemented in the application. These research bases ensure that goCBC's calculations are grounded in current scientific understanding of substance pharmacokinetics.

## Available Research Documents

### Caffeine
- **[Caffeine Pharmacokinetic Analysis](./caffeine-pharmacokinetic-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of caffeine metabolism, half-life variability, and factors affecting clearance rates. Covers genetic polymorphisms, population differences, and clinical applications.

### Nicotine  
- **[Nicotine Pharmacokinetic Analysis](./nicotine-pharmacokinetic-analysis.md)** - Detailed examination of nicotine metabolism pathways, individual variability, and factors influencing elimination rates. Includes analysis of chronic smoking effects and population-specific differences.

## Research Methodology

Each analysis follows a systematic approach:

1. **Literature Review** - Comprehensive survey of peer-reviewed pharmacokinetic studies
2. **Meta-Analysis** - Statistical synthesis of multiple studies to determine representative values
3. **Population Variability** - Assessment of genetic, demographic, and physiological factors
4. **Clinical Validation** - Verification against real-world clinical data
5. **Implementation Rationale** - Justification for specific parameter values used in goCBC

## Contributing Research

When adding new substances or updating existing parameters:

1. Create a comprehensive pharmacokinetic analysis document following the established format
2. Include peer-reviewed references and statistical analyses
3. Document the rationale for chosen parameter values
4. Update this README with links to new research documents
