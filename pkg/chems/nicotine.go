## Important Notes on Bioavailability

- **Absorption rates vary significantly** based on pH, individual metabolism, and usage technique
- **Cigarette absorption** typically 10-20% of total nicotine content
- **Oral products** absorption heavily influenced by pH (optimal 8.0-9.0)
- **Transdermal patches** provide most consistent and complete absorption (76-82%)
- **Individual variation** can be 4-fold due to genetic factors (CYP2A6 polymorphisms)
- **Peak plasma levels** range from 2-5 minutes (cigarettes) to 6-12 hours (patches)
